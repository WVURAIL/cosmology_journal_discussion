# cosmology_journal_discussion
In this journal club, we, in general, discuss research papers in the field of cosmology and talk about related concepts, latest discoveries & news. Cosmology, in simple words, is a branch of astronomy which involves study of the origin and evolution of the universe; it's a scientific study of the large scale properties of the universe as a whole. What we simply do here is presenting any paper (shortlist a few interesting, latest papers and pick any one from it) by one of us in ~15 minutes and talk about it further. 

This repository includes the journal paper discussed, to be discussed and notes on the discussed papers from the members.
