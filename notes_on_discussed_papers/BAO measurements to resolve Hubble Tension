This paper talks about important role played by baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements in constraining the value of H0 and in turn resolving 
Hubble Constant descripancy. Since BAO data solely cannot constrain the value of H0, the authors have combined the latest BAO results with CMB data from 
WMAP, SPT, ACT i.e. independent of Planck CMB data. Combining galaxy and Ly-alpha forest (Lyα) BAO with precise estimate of primordial Deuterium abundance 
have also been carried out to establish the value of H0.

BAO measurements have been combined with anisotropic CMB data from specific datasets and it has been observed that the BAO have the effect of disfavoring 
both the higher values of H0 preferred by the distance ladder, and the lower values preferred by the Planck damping tail at l > 800. Combining ACTPol and 
BAO data produces an H0 value > 3σ lower than R16 provides strong evidence that the H0 discrepancy cannot be explained solely by a systematic specific to 
the Planck data. Authors have also studied the transverse (DM /rd) and line-of-sight (Hrd) BAO contours separately, as well as the contour from combining 
both, and the angle-averaged DV (z)/rd contour. There is shift in H0 from using the angle-averaged Dv(z)/rd instead of the full anisotropic BAO information
and it is due to the compression of information inherent to Dv(z)/rd. Therefore it's preferable to use the anisotropic constraints wherever possible.

The combined BAO and Deuterium constraint, H0 = 66.98 ± 1.18 (km s−1 Mpc−1) is 3.0σ lower than the distance ladder determination and is independent of CMB 
anisotropy data. 

Authors find convincing evidence for lower values of H0 in ΛCDM than obtained from the latest local distance ladder measurement (73.24±1.74 km s−1 Mpc−1) 
even without using data from Planck.
