This paper reviews potential proposed models of Early Dark Energy (EDE) that can be used to resolve the Hubble Tension, the discrepancy between Hubble 
constant (H0) determined by direct measurements (using distance ladder method) and indirect measurements (the value inferred rely on the ΛCDM cosmological 
model calibrated on early-universe).

Primary discussed matter:
1. Different techniques and datasets that can be used for direct as well as indirect measurements of H0 to remove any biases from particular datasets:
"early-universe" measurement methods include- altenative CMB datasets, measurements of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) with data from baryon acoustic 
oscillations (BAO)
"late-universe" measurement methods include- calibration of SNIa using the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), surface brightness fluctuations of galaxies, 
the Baryonic Tully Fisher relation, and Mira variables; measurements using cephieds; time-delay of strongly-lensed quasars; maser distances; cosmic 
chronometers; the age of old stars; gravitational waves as “standard sirens”
2. Comparison of the reconstructed maximum fractional contribution of EDE to the energy density of the universe for proposed EDE models, and the associated 
value of H0
3. Angular scale of sound horizon and derivation of Hubble constant in terms of physical size of the sound horizon and angular diameter distance of the 
observation

Current data remains inclonclusive on the existence of the EDE phase and next-generation experiments might be able to tell whether EDE is the mechanism 
responsible for the Hubble Tension.
